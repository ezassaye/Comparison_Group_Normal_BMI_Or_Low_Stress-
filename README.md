# Predictive Model for Sleep Disorders: Using Machine Learning to Identify Insomnia and Sleep Apnea Based on Lifestyle Factors

Sleep Disorder Prediction System
Technologies: Python, Machine Learning, FastAPI, XGBoost, SMOTE

Developed a machine learning model to predict sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnea using real-world lifestyle and clinical data.

Combined and cleaned multiple public datasets to identify key predictors of sleep health, including stress level, BMI, and sleep duration.

Applied advanced techniques like feature engineering, XGBoost, and SMOTE to improve model accuracy and ensure balanced predictions across sleep disorder classes.

Built and deployed an interactive web application using FastAPI, allowing users to input daily habits and receive real-time predictions on their risk of sleep disorders.

Designed the tool to promote early detection and help users take preventive actions before symptoms worsen.
